(Enem/2022)  QUESTÃO 01 
As my official bio reads, I was made in Cuba, assembled 
in Spain, and imported to the United States — meaning my 
mother, seven months pregnant, and the rest of my family 
arrived as exiles from Cuba to Madrid, where I was born. 
Less than two months later, we emigrated once more and 
settled in New York City, then eventually in Miami, where 
I was raised and educated. Although technically we lived 
in the United States, the Cuban community was culturally 
insular in Miami during the 1970s, bonded together by the 
trauma of exile. What’s more, it seemed that practically 
everyone was Cuban: my teachers, my classmates, the 
mechanic, the bus driver. I didn’t grow up feeling different 
or treated as a minority. The few kids who got picked on 
in my grade school were the ones with freckles and funny 
last names like Dawson and O’Neil.

(Enem/2022)  QUESTÃO 02 
Two hundred years ago, Jane Austen lived in a world 
where single men boasted vast estates; single ladies 
were expected to speak several languages, sing and play 
the piano. In both cases, it was, of course, advantageous 
if you looked good too. So, how much has — or hasn’t 
— changed? Dating apps opaquely outline the demands 
of today’s relationship market; users ruminate long and 
hard over their choice of pictures and what they write in 
their biographies to hook in potential lovers, and that’s just 
your own profile. What do you look for in a future partner’s 
profile — potential signifiers of a popular personality, a 
good job, a nice car? These apps are a poignant reminder 
of the often classist attitudes we still adopt, as well as 
the financial and aesthetic expectations we demand from 
potential partners.

(Enem/2022)  QUESTÃO 04 
A Teen’s View of Social Media
Instagram is made up of all photos and videos. There 
is the home page that showcases the posts from people 
you follow, an explore tab which offers posts from accounts 
all over the world, and your own page, with a notification 
tab to show who likes and comments on your posts.
It has some downsides though. It is known to make 
many people feel insecure or down about themselves 
because the platform showcases the highlights of 
everyone’s lives, while rarely showing the negatives. 
This can make one feel like their life is not going as well 
as others, contributing to the growing rates of anxiety or 
depression in many teens today. There is an underlying 
desire for acceptance through the number of likes or 
followers one has.
